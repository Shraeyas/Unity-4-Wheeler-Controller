# Unity-4-Wheeler-Controller
Simple 4 Wheeler Vehicle Controller for Unity



If someone wishes to, then they can just use this as a template to create a 4 wheeler vehicle.

This one has been created by applying Torque on wheel colliders.

There was a tutorial by Unity where they were applying force to the rigid body to make it move instead of using the Torque values for the wheel colliders. That is because Unity knows that the wheel colliders suck and they themselves couldn't make them work (Typical unity, always coming out with half baked features).
